This is a personal list of applications (desktop/web) and services that I use as a software developer and computer user. I'm always on the lookout for better tools to make my life and work simpler.

There are tons of great applications out there for every problem but these are the ones that worked for me. This is where I curate them.
 
Heavily inspired by [Scott Hanselman's Dev Tool List](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2014UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx).
